        To engage in battles on the Azov Sea, the Russian Maritime Fleet
        required not only sail-and-oar galleys and galleasses, primarily
        designed for coastal navigation, but also sailing ships capable of
        undertaking long voyages and armed with formidable artillery. Such
        vessels had not been constructed previously in Russia. Thus, on November
        19, 1698, it was decided to commence the construction of the first
        Russian ship of the line, named "Goto Predestinatsia" ("Godâ€™s
        Providence"), which represented the most formidable type of ships of
        that era.

        Building Ships for the Azov Fleet Thanks in large part to the successful
        action of the ships that blocked the waterway to the Turkish fortress,
        in July 1696 Azov was captured. The capture of Azov blocked the Don
        estuary, which enabled the Russian ships to sail in the Azov Sea. On
        October 20, 1696, a far-reaching decision was adopted: "Sea Vessels
        Shall Be"!

              Reconstruction of "Goto Predestinatsia", the First Russian warship

              Never in history has our region enjoyed such a high-profile status
              as during the time of Peter the Great. The initiation of
              shipbuilding created perfect conditions for the rapid development
              of the region, resulting in Voronezh obtaining and maintaining its
              status as a significant agrarian, industrial, and cultural centre.
              To this day, every resident of Voronezh is aware and proud of the
              fact that they live in the city that is the cradle of the Russian
              Navy.
